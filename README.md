# Campus-Recruitment
The aim of this project is to determine what variables can increase the chances of securing a job placement in college recruitment event. We will be doing visualization and predictive model to classify if a given student can get a placement or not.
Placements are considered to be very important for each and every college. The basic success of the college is measured by the campus placement of the students. Every student takes admission to the colleges by seeing the percentage of placements in the college. Hence, in this regard the approach is about the prediction and analyses for the placement necessity in the colleges that helps to build the colleges as well as students to improve their placements.
Almost each and every student has to go through placement process during the final year of their respective university courses. But what factor really affects the placement of student? Is it their college degree percentage? School percentage? Performance in entrance test of company? We will be studying about all these factors in this project. Not only this we will also be developing a predictive model to classify if a given student can get a placement or not.

# Conclusion
Finally conclusion is that it seems like academic results have limited effect on securing a job placement. Specialisation seems to play a much more important role. Males have a better chance of getting chosen for the job placement. Males also have a better chance of getting higher pay. And RandomForestClassifier is predicting best among all classification model with 90 percent.
